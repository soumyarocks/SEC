program standard_deviation

implicit none

integer :: n, i
real :: x(100), mean, variance, std_deviation

! Read in the number of data points
print*, "Enter the number of data points (up to 100): "
read*, n

! Read in the data points
print*, "Enter the data points: "
do i = 1, n
    read*, x(i)
end do

! Calculate the mean
mean = sum(x(1:n))/n

! Calculate the variance
variance = sum((x(1:n)-mean)**2)/n

! Calculate the standard deviation
std_deviation = sqrt(variance)

! Output the results
print*, "Mean = ", mean
print*, "Variance = ", variance
print*, "Standard deviation = ", std_deviation
